# [M5] open decisions taken by the cloud session (2026-09-24), for maintainer review

The maintainer handed over on 2026-09-24 with "make the open decisions and mark the commits; we'll
discuss tomorrow". Each decision below has an ID. Every commit implementing one is tagged `[Dn]` in
its subject line (`git log --oneline --grep '\[D'`). Each entry lists the choice, the evidence,
the alternatives, and how to revert it. Nothing here changes the reward weights or PPO
hyperparameters beyond what is listed.

| ID | Decision | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | Detach signal: what the envelope reads (torque noise / bending / torsion) | pending CPU checks |
| D2 | Task 11 gate: success AND safety AND collateral vs scripted pull, AND >= random | done |
| D3 | F/T sensor-noise preset calibrated on the real rig | done (`be9465b`, pre-dates the tags) |

## D2 -- Task 11 exit gate includes collateral

**Choice.** `apple_pick_gym/rl/gate.py`. A learned policy passes only if, on the same held-out
snapshot and seed, all of these hold:
- success >= scripted pull;
- safety <= scripted pull;
- peak collateral <= 0.5 x scripted pull's;
- success >= random.

**Evidence.**
- On GPU (sim_wiring_gpu, 64 worlds), scripted pull detaches at 19 N junction force with 45 N peak
  collateral. The plan's gate ("beat scripted pull on success, no worse safety") would accept a
  policy that reproduces that.
- Random reached 1.00 success under the total-moment envelope, so beating random guards against
  an envelope a policy can trip by accident.

**Alternatives.**
- Success-only gate (the plan).
- A weighted score.
- Comparing against scripted twist-pull.

The 0.5 ratio is a judgement call. It demands a clear improvement in the thing the task is about.

**Revert.** Use `--collateral-ratio 1e9` and omit `--random`, or ignore the tool.

## D3 -- F/T sensor noise from real data

**Choice.** `FtSensorConfig.rl_training().noise_std = (0.12, 0.11, 0.12, 0.04, 0.05, 0.005)`, measured
on the real rig's quiet unloaded holds (s02, 32 segments, ~60 Hz block mean).
- Bias and drift remain estimates: they can't be measured from the sys-ID data.
- Torque bias was raised to 0.05 N*m (Tz 0.005).

**Evidence.** The local GPU session's Q3 table. The previous guess had Tx/Ty noise 10x too low.

**Revert.** `git revert be9465b`.
