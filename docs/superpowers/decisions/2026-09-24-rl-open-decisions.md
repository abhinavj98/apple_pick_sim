# [M5] open decisions taken by the cloud session (2026-09-24), for maintainer review

The maintainer handed over on 2026-09-24 with "make the open decisions and mark the commits; we'll
discuss tomorrow". Each decision below has an ID. Every commit implementing one is tagged `[Dn]` in
its subject line (`git log --oneline --grep '\[D'`). Each entry lists the choice, the evidence,
the alternatives, and how to revert it. Nothing here changes the reward weights or PPO
hyperparameters beyond what is listed.

| ID | Decision | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | Detach signal: what the envelope reads (torque noise / bending / torsion) | pending CPU checks |
| D2 | Task 11 gate: success AND safety AND collateral vs scripted pull, AND >= random | done |
| D3 | F/T sensor model matched to the real rig: noise and online EMA corner (8.2 Hz) | done |
| D4 | F/T observation frame for deployment (sim is world frame; rig is mixed) | flagged, no code change |

## D2 -- Task 11 exit gate includes collateral

**Choice.** `apple_pick_gym/rl/gate.py`. A learned policy passes only if, on the same held-out
snapshot and seed, all of these hold:
- success >= scripted pull;
- safety <= scripted pull;
- peak collateral <= 0.5 x scripted pull's;
- success >= random.

**Evidence.**
- On GPU (sim_wiring_gpu, 64 worlds), scripted pull detaches at 19 N junction force with 45 N peak
  collateral. The plan's gate ("beat scripted pull on success, no worse safety") would accept a
  policy that reproduces that.
- Random reached 1.00 success under the total-moment envelope, so beating random guards against
  an envelope a policy can trip by accident.

**Alternatives.**
- Success-only gate (the plan).
- A weighted score.
- Comparing against scripted twist-pull.

The 0.5 ratio is a judgement call. It demands a clear improvement in the thing the task is about.

**Revert.** Use `--collateral-ratio 1e9` and omit `--random`, or ignore the tool.

## D3 -- F/T sensor noise from real data

**Choice.** `FtSensorConfig.rl_training().noise_std = (0.12, 0.11, 0.12, 0.04, 0.05, 0.005)`, measured
on the real rig's quiet unloaded holds (s02, 32 segments, ~60 Hz block mean).
- Bias and drift remain estimates: they can't be measured from the sys-ID data.
- Torque bias was raised to 0.05 N*m (Tz 0.005).

**Evidence.** The local GPU session's Q3 table. The previous guess had Tx/Ty noise 10x too low.

**Where the noise is added (maintainer note: real F/T is EMA'd and low-passed during conversion).**
- 60 Hz block-averaging barely reduced the measured noise. White 1 kHz noise would drop ~4x, so
  the measured column was already low-passed.
- The measured std is therefore post-filter noise, which is where the sim adds it (after its
  causal EMA). The calibration is consistent.
- **Online filter (resolved).** From `real_robot_exps` code (local session): the rig reads Franka's
  external-wrench *estimate* `K_F_ext_hat_K` at 1 kHz, subtracts a bias, and EMAs it online with
  `ft_ema_alpha` = 0.05 (config since 2026-08-17; the s02 data is 2026-08-20). That gives
  fc = -ln(0.95) * 1000 / 2pi ~ 8.2 Hz.
  - `rl_training()` now uses `cutoff_hz=8.16` (was 10).
  - The collected `ft_wrist_raw` is that EMA'd signal, so the measured noise is post-filter, as
    modelled.
- The offline zero-phase `filtfilt` used for sys-ID scoring is non-causal. It is deliberately not
  modelled in the policy's observation.

**Revert.** `git revert be9465b`.

## D4 -- F/T frame convention (flagged for the maintainer; no code change)

**Finding (local session, from code).**
- The sim observes `ft_wrist` as the world-frame TCP coupling wrench.
- The sys-ID converter rotates real F/T into that frame (`R(tcp) @ F/T`, ROADMAP slice 1).
- The live rig path is not in that frame:
  - it reads `K_F_ext_hat_K`, which is stiffness-frame;
  - one read path only negates, another rotates base -> body;
  - dataset metadata says "force in EE frame, torque in base frame";
  - the per-episode bias tare averages `O_F_ext_hat_K` (base frame) and subtracts it from the
    K-frame signal. That is a frame mismatch whenever the K and O frames differ.

**Decision.**
- Keep the sim contract (world frame).
- Deployment must apply the same transform as the converter before feeding the policy.
- The rig-side tare frame mismatch is for the maintainer to confirm and fix on the rig. It also
  bears on the M4.0 torque-magnitude gate: a wrong torque frame or tare changes torque
  magnitudes.
